**How did I make this website?**
I originally used plain HTML with no CSS to create a quick prototype. All the website needs to do is make POST requests to my [Dashboard API server](https://github.com/PicoPlanetDev/dashboard-api) that manages the database. However, I realized that most users would be interacting with the website on mobile, so I decided to learn (the very very most basic) basics of Bootstrap so my site would be responsive.

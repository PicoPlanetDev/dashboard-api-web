# Dashboard API Web
This repository hosts a web page interface for my Grades Dashboard action for Google Assistant, allowing users to create, edit, and delete information on their accounts.

## Important
Google announced on June 13, 2022 that Conversational Actions,
the platform that Grades Dashboard is built upon, will be deprecated and no longer available after June
12, 2023. In the meantime, you will still be able to interact with Grades Dashboard but development will be
halted due to removal of conversation-building tools. While this is unfortunate
for Grades Dashboard, there are alternative paths that this may take in the future that will
still allow you to interact with Grades Dashboard by voice. Thank you for your
support in the development of Grades Dashboard.

**How did I make this website?**
I originally used plain HTML with no CSS to create a quick prototype. All the website needs to do is make POST requests to my [Dashboard API server](https://github.com/PicoPlanetDev/dashboard-api) that manages the database. However, I realized that most users would be interacting with the website on mobile, so I decided to learn (the very very most basic) basics of Bootstrap so my site would be responsive.
